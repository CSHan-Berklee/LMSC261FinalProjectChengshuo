The diffsinger directory is a clone of the official opensource model made by OpenVPI which I will be using in the future.
For this project I have only got the scoreparser which will be one element of the input of the backend engine. 
The index.html is a simple indication of what the interface should do but it is missing a midi+lyrics to json list file conversion function.
