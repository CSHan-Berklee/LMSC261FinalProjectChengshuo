#LMSC261 Final Chengshuo
The \diffsinger\ directory is just a clone from the opensource model by OPENVPI
In my \project\ I wrote the score_parser, an indication of the input in the \index.html, a demo of a required json file for backend engine input. The interface is an indication of what inputs can be accpeted but it is missing a function of converting midi and lyrics to json list file. 
I will be working on this project for EP491 the intended final result for this project is described in the control flow diagram but I still need more knowledge to actually complete it.
